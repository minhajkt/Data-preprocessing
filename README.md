# Data-preprocessing

In this project a dataset is taken to acount and preprocessing is done on it.
The main objective is to desing and implement a robust data preprocessing system which is can handle 
common issues like missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise.

## Data Exploration
The fiven data is first explred and unique values and found.
Statsitical analysis ont he data is done.

## Data Cleaning
The misisng data are found and they are either replaced with mean, mode or median or
removed from teh dataset.
Age with values 0 are replaced by'NaN'.

## Data Analysis
Age > 40 and Salary < 5000 are filtered out and displayed.
A chart with age and salary on x and y axis respectively are plotted.
A barchart showing the number of people from each place is plotted.

## Data Encoding
Categorical Values are converted into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding.

## Feature Scaling
After the encoding process, scaling of features are done using Standard Scaler and Minmax Scaler.
